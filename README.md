# spark streaming visualization
Based on driver program, I let as an exercise for interested reader, the dataset creation
Spark streaming allows us to process in real time massive data. Here I use a dynamic dashboard to vilualize data.

Real time simulated business sales streamed to  Apache Spark big data engine
Simulate business sales of 3 items coming from 3 cities 
Map and Reduce them with Spark Streaming on standalone mode with 2 cores
Use of web sockets to transfer processed data to a web browser
Final user can follow real time business data on interactive and animated dashboard (d3.js)
